Base URL
========

Unless otherwise noted, all URLs referenced in this documentation have the following base:

    ``https://developers.youversion.com/api/1.0``

Our APIs are served over HTTPS. Unencrypted HTTP connections are not supported.


Authentication
==============

Requests are authenticated by sending along a YouVersion API Developer Token.

That token is sent as a request header ``X-YouVersion-Developer-Token``, the value of which is provided in the YouVersion API Developers Portal.

In addition to that token, our API endpoints expect a couple **required** headers
to be sent along with the request. Currently, those are:


Required Headers
----------------

The following HTTP request headers *must* be present, with a valid value,
for any request to the public API:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 50 50

    * - Header
      - Description
    * - ``x-youversion-developer-token``
      - **Required**. Your personal API access token, provided in the YouVersion API Developers Portal.
    * - ``accept``
      - **Required**. Presently we'll be responding to public APIs with JSON, so the valid value here is ``application/json``.
    * - ``host``
      - **Required**. Almost always sent automatically by clients, so you likely don't have to provide this explicitly. Usually contains the domain portion of the request URL, e.g. ``developers.youversionapi.com``.
    * - ``user-agent``
      - **Required**. Provided automatically by many clients. This header must have a value for the request to be considered valid. This can be the name of your app or API client.


Here are some examples showing what a valid request might look like for getting the :doc:`Verse Of The Day <api/votd>` for the first day of the year:

.. content-tabs::

    .. tab-container:: curl
        :title: curl

        .. code-block:: text

            curl --request GET \
                --url https://developers.youversionapi.com/1.0/verse_of_the_day/1?version_id=1 \
                --header 'accept: application/json' \
                --header 'x-youversion-developer-token: {your_developer_token}'

    .. tab-container:: js
        :title: javascript

        .. code-block:: javascript

            fetch('https://developers.youversionapi.com/1.0/verse_of_the_day/1?version_id=1', {
            headers: {
                'X-YouVersion-Developer-Token': '{your_developer_token}',
                Accept: 'application/json',
            }
            })
            .then((result) => result.json())
            .then((json) => console.log(json))

    .. tab-container:: python
        :title: python

        .. code-block:: python

            import os

            import requests

            # Assuming you keep your tokens in environment variables:
            YOUVERSION_DEVELOPER_TOKEN = os.environ["YOUVERSION_DEVELOPER_TOKEN"]

            headers = {
                "accept": "application/json",
                "x-youversion-developer-token": YOUVERSION_DEVELOPER_TOKEN,
                "accept-language": "en",
            }

            response = requests.get(
                "https://developers.youversionapi.com/1.0/verse_of_the_day/1?version_id=1",
                headers=headers
            )

            print(response.content)


Optional Headers
----------------

Some API endpoints accept optional headers, for various purposes. We'll
try to document those inline with their respective purposes. This is just
an overview of some possibilities.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 50 50

    * - Optional Header
      - Description
    * - ``accept-language``
      - **Optional**. Some API endpoints use the ``accept-language`` header to
        determine appropriate content to return for the request. For a specific
        example, see :ref:`api-votd-images`.


.. _getting-an-api-token:

Getting an API Token
====================

Visit the YouVersion API Developers Portal: https://developers.youversion.com

Sign in there with your existing YouVersion account credentials to authorize
the app to supply your account with a developer token.

Once the app is authorized with your YouVersion account you should see an
option to "Get My Token".

After requesting an API token, you should see a new token appear. You can
copy this token for use in making authorized requests to the API.
Something like this:

.. image:: getting-started-token-example.png

You can also use the "refresh" option to deactivate your current token, and
have a new one created for you.
